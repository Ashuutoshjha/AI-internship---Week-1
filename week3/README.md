## 🌱 **Project Title**

**CNN-Based Waste Classification for Sustainable Waste Management**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To finalize and document the AI-based sustainability project by:

* Evaluating the trained CNN model through real-time predictions.
* Creating a presentation to summarize the project workflow and results.
* Preparing the repository for submission and future enhancements.

---

## 🧠 **Project Overview**

This week focuses on testing, documentation, and deployment readiness.
The CNN model developed in Week 2 and improved in Week 3 is now tested on real-world images of waste to ensure accurate classification between **Organic** and **Recyclable** categories.

---

## 🧩 **Key Tasks Completed**

1. **Model Testing:**

   * Uploaded real waste images (e.g., kitchen waste, plastic bottles).
   * Verified predictions with high confidence scores.
   * Displayed results visually with prediction labels.

2. **Model Optimization Recap:**

   * Implemented **Data Augmentation** to improve generalization.
   * Added **EarlyStopping** to prevent overfitting.
   * Used **Learning Rate Reduction** for stable convergence.

3. **Visualization & Output:**

   * Plotted Accuracy and Loss graphs.
   * Displayed sample predictions with actual images.
   * Verified performance with unseen data.

4. **Final Presentation:**

   * Created a professional PPT summarizing the entire project lifecycle.
   * Included model workflow, methodology, and output screenshots.

## 💡 **Conclusion**

* The CNN model successfully automates waste classification.
* Demonstrated the role of AI in sustainable waste management.
* Achieved strong validation accuracy and consistent performance.
* Can be deployed as a **Streamlit Web App** or integrated with **IoT smart bins**.

---

## 🚀 **Future Scope**

* Integration with IoT sensors for live waste sorting.
* Deployment as a mobile/web application.
* Expanding dataset for multi-category waste classification (e.g., glass, paper, metal).
