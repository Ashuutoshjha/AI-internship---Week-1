# 🌱 Week 1 – CNN-Based Waste Classification for Sustainable Waste Management

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains my Week 1 task for the **AI Internship** under the theme of **Sustainability**.  
The project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to automatically classify waste into **organic** and **recyclable** categories using image data.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Improper waste segregation causes severe environmental damage and limits recycling efficiency.  
This project aims to develop a CNN-based model that can identify and classify waste images, supporting automation in waste management and promoting sustainable recycling processes.

## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Dataset Used:** [Waste Classification Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data)  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and train–test splitting.  
3. **Model Design:** CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.  
4. **Model Training:** Image classification into two classes – Organic and Recyclable.  
5. **Evaluation:** Accuracy metrics and confusion matrix.
